**WL AI Director** is an **AI-powered, one-stop platform** for **short dramas** and **motion comics**, built for creators who want to go from idea to final video fast.

Moving away from the traditional "slot machine" style of random generation, WL AI Director adopts an industrial **"Script-to-Asset-to-Keyframe"** workflow. With deep integration of AntSK API's advanced AI models, it enables **one-sentence to complete drama** — fully automated from **script** to **final video**, while maintaining precise control over character consistency, scene continuity, and camera movement.

## Core Philosophy: Keyframe-Driven

Traditional Text-to-Video models often struggle with specific camera movements and precise start/end states. WL AI Director introduces the animation concept of **Keyframes**:

1.  **Draw First, Move Later**: First, generate precise Start and End frames.
2.  **Interpolation**: Use the Veo model to generate smooth video transitions between these two frames.
3.  **Asset Constraint**: All visual generation is strictly constrained by "Character Sheets" and "Scene Concepts" to prevent hallucinations or inconsistencies.

## Key Features

### Phase 01: Script & Storyboard
*   **Intelligent Breakdown**: Input a novel or story outline, and the AI automatically breaks it down into a standard script structure (Scenes, Time, Atmosphere).
*   **Visual Translation**: Automatically converts text descriptions into professional visual prompts.
*   **Pacing Control**: Set target durations (e.g., 30s Teaser, 3min Short), and the AI plans shot density accordingly.
*   **✨ Manual Editing (NEW)**:
    *   Edit character visual descriptions and shot prompts
    *   Edit character list for each shot (add/remove characters)
    *   Edit action descriptions and dialogues for each shot
    *   Ensure generated results meet expectations with precise control over every detail

### Phase 02: Assets & Casting
*   **Character Consistency**:
    *   Generate standard Reference Images for every character.
    *   **Wardrobe System**: Support for multiple looks (e.g., Casual, Combat, Injured) while maintaining facial identity based on a Base Look.
*   **Set Design**: Generate environmental reference images to ensure lighting consistency across different shots in the same location.

### Phase 03: Director Workbench
*   **Grid Storyboard**: Manage all shots in a panoramic view.
*   **Precise Control**:
    *   **Start Frame**: The strictly consistent starting image of the shot.
    *   **End Frame**: (Optional) Define the state at the end of the shot (e.g., character turns head, lighting shifts).
*   **Nine-Grid Storyboard Preview (NEW)**:
    *   Split one shot into 9 viewpoints, review/edit panel descriptions, then generate the 3x3 storyboard image.
    *   Use the whole grid as the start frame, or crop a selected panel as the start frame.
*   **Context Awareness**: When generating shots, the AI automatically reads the Context (Current Scene Image + Character's Specific Outfit Image) to solve continuity issues.
*   **Dual Video Modes**: Supports single-image Image-to-Video and Start/End keyframe interpolation.

### Phase 04: Export
*   **Timeline Preview**: Preview generated motion comic segments in a timeline format.
*   **Render Tracking**: Monitor API render progress in real-time.
*   **Asset Export**: Export all high-def keyframes and MP4 clips for post-production in Premiere/After Effects.

## Tech Stack

## ⚠️ Open-Source & “Free” Clarification (Please Read)

* **Model usage note**: This open-source project’s default workflow requires a capability-matched model stack, for example an LLM (such as **GPT-5.2**), an image model (such as **Nano Banana Pro**), and a video model (such as **Sora-2** / **Veo-3.1**). If you want to connect other providers or models, you can modify and adapt it yourself.
* **Why we open-sourced this**: Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry and make creation more accessible. The project code is open-source, and model configuration is replaceable.
* **About our API service**: The API we provide is mainly for quick experience and integration, not as a core profit source.
* **Freedom of choice**: If our API does not meet your expectations, you can absolutely use official OpenAI or Google services directly (even at a higher price). That is a normal and respected choice.
* **About “always free” expectations**: If your primary criterion is long-term “must be free,” this project may not be the best fit for you.

## Quick Start

1.  **Configure Key**: Launch the app and input your AntSK API Key. [**Buy API Key**](https://api.antsk.cn)
2.  **Input Story**: In Phase 01, enter your story idea and click "Generate Script".
3.  **Art Direction**: Go to Phase 02, generate character sheets and scene concepts.
4.  **Shot Production**: In Phase 03, generate the Start Frame first; for tighter control, add an End Frame or use the Nine-Grid preview to choose Start Frame composition.
5.  **Motion Generation**: Select a video model and generate clips; Start-only frames can produce single-image video, while Start+End frames provide more stable transitions.
